#About the repositry:
This repository contains data from long-term incubation experiment conducted in České Budějovice. The code analyzing the data will be added to the repository irregularly. It all depends on work progress.

#About the soils: 
The incubation experiment was conducted with two different soils sampled in two different forested catchments in Czech Republic (Plesne and Certovo lake catchments). The catchments are intensivily studies for last 20 years. To learn more about the catchment, follow the publication of Jiri Kopacek. 

#About the experiment
The soils were supplemented with 13C labelled glucose and incubated for two months in dark at 15°C. Several carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus pools and/or fluxes were measured over time. The signal of labelled glucose was tracked into all relevant pools.
